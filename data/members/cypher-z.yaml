description: I am Yiming Zhang, currently a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University, a premier research institution in Asia. My primary research interests lie in the security risks of Internet infrastructure, with a particular focus on the security of public key infrastructure (PKI). My work is driven purely by academic and research pursuits, without any profit motive.  I have a strong background in PKI research, evidenced by my publication as the first author in CCS 2021, one of the top four conferences on network security:  Rusted Anchors: A National Client-Side View of Hidden Root CAs in the Web PKI Ecosystem, [CCS' 21] https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3484768
